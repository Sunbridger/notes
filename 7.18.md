# package.json `type` field
> The "type" field defines how .js and extensionless files should be treated within a particular package.json file’s package scope. 

<hr>
```
// package.json
{
  "type": "module"
}
// all  file in an ES module package scope because there is a package.json
// file in the same folder with "type": "module".
```
Files ending with .js or .mjs, or lacking any extension, will be loaded as ES modules when the nearest parent package.json file contains a top-level field "type" with a value of "module".


> If the nearest parent package.json lacks a "type" field, or contains "type": "commonjs", extensionless and .js files are treated as CommonJS. (default is commonjs)


- `node --experimental-modules my-app.js` 也是能在不具备type字段式命令行来作为esmodule来执行 但是这仅仅只是个试验性 真正使用(node:33919) ExperimentalWarning: The ESM module loader is experimental.错误

- Files ending with .mjs are always loaded as ES modules regardless of package scope.

- Files ending with .cjs are always loaded as CommonJS regardless of package scope.

# package scope
A folder containing a package.json file, and all subfolders below that folder down until the next folder containing another package.json, is considered a package scope. 

# package.json `main` field
> defines the entry point for a package, whether the package is included into CommonJS via require or into an ES module via import.

The "main" field can point to exactly one file, regardless of whether the package is referenced via `require `(in a CommonJS context) or` import` (in an ES module context).

# import说明
- Bare specifiers like 'some-package'。They refer to an entry point of a package by the package name.
- Deep import specifiers like 'some-package/lib/shuffle.mjs'. They refer to a path within a package prefixed（前缀） by the package name.
- Relative specifiers like './startup.js' or '../config.mjs'. They refer to a path relative to the location of the importing file.
- Absolute specifiers like 'file:///opt/nodejs/config.js' . They refer directly and explicitly to a full path.

> Specifiers(说明符) may not begin with / or //. These are reserved for potential future use. The root of the current volume（容量，卷盘） may be referenced via file:///.
