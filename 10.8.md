# vue3.0的一些
We have achieved most of the architectural goals and new features planned for v3:

1. Compiler

 Modular architecture (模块化结构)
 "Block tree" optimization （阻止树的优化）
 More aggressive static tree hoisting （更好的静态树提升）
 Source map support 
 Built-in identifier prefixing (aka "stripWith") （内置了标识的前缀）
 Built-in pretty-printing （内置打印格式）
 Lean ~10kb brotli-compressed browser build after dropping source map and identifier prefixing （10kb左右压缩后）
2. Runtime

 Significantly faster
 Simultaneous Composition API + Options API support, with typings
 Proxy-based change detection
 Fragments
 Portals
 Suspense w/ async setup()



 ```
However, there are still some 2.x parity features not completed yet:
Server-side rendering (服务端渲染)
 <keep-alive>
 <transition>
 Compiler DOM-specific transforms
 v-on DOM modifiers
 v-model
 v-text
 v-pre
 v-once
 v-html
 v-show
The current implementation also requires native ES2015+ in the runtime environment and does not support IE11 (yet)```
